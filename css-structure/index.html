          Swift began songwriting professionally at age 14 and signed with Big
          Machine Records in 2005 to become a country musician. Under Big
          Machine, she released six studio albums, four of them to country
          radio, starting with her self-titled album (2006). Her next record,
          Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles "Love Story"
          and "You Belong with Me" catapulted her to mainstream fame. Speak Now
          (2010) incorporated rock influences, and Red (2012) experimented with
          electronic elements and featured Swift's first Billboard Hot 100
          number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". She
          forwent her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album
          supported by chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and
          "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired her next album, the
          hip-hop-flavored Reputation (2017), and its number-one single "Look
          What You Made Me Do".

          After signing a new contract with Republic Records in 2018, Swift
          released her seventh album, Lover (2019), and autobiographical
          documentary, Miss Americana (2020). She embraced indie folk and
          alternative rock on her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore and explored
          chill-out styles on Midnights (2022). The albums broke multifarious
          records, led by the respective number-one singles "Cardigan",
          "Willow", and "Anti-Hero". A dispute with Big Machine led Swift to
          re-record her first six albums, having launched three of them from
          2021 to 2023, including Red (Taylor's Version), whose track "All Too
          Well (10 Minute Version)" became the longest song to top the Hot 100.
          Swift has directed music videos and films such as All Too Well: The
          Short Film (2021) and played supporting roles in others.
